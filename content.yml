  title1: "Commit Funds <br/> ≠ Invest nor Buy"
  paragraph1a:  |
        You stay in control of all your committed funds.
        You decide in which startups you will invest your
        funds in the future. The Neufund Platform’s goal
        is to make many investment opportunities available..
  paragraph1b:  |
        Fifth Force, the Platform operator,
        cultivates the decentralised investment
        ecosystem by kickstarting the startup
        deal flow and providing legal & technical
        infrastructure. <strong> It does not manage
        your funds for you.</strong>
  point2: "02"
  title2: "Reward: Neumarks<br/> = Share in the Ecosystem"
  paragraph2a:  |
        When you commit funds you get a reward,
        the Neumark token. By owning Neumarks you
        own a share of the ecosystem, you have a
        right to its revenue and to the Neufund
        Platform portfolio. You actively increase
        its value by investing in startups.
  paragraph2b:  |
        <strong>The sooner you commit your funds
        the higher your reward.</strong> You can
        capitalize on Neumarks by hodling them
        to receive revenue or by trading them on
        the market.
